# Deep_Learning
A repository dedicated to deep learning algorithms such as Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Networks, Stacked Auto Encoders, Deep Belief Networks, Deep Boltzmann Machines, and Generative Adversarial Networks.

The deep learning algorithm libraries will be written in Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, Theano, and More.

These files will be written in Python(3.7)
